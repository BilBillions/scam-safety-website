        <h1>5 Red Flags You're Talking to a Scammer</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Published: June 2025</p>

        <p>Online scammers often rely on a predictable script. They use emotional manipulation and create a false sense of urgency to bypass your rational judgment. Being aware of their tactics is the first step to protecting yourself. Here are 5 common red flags to look out for:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>They avoid video calls.</strong> They will always have an excuse for why they can't video chat. Their camera is broken, the internet is bad, or they are in a location where it's not allowed. This is a major red flag as it prevents you from seeing they are not the person in their photos.</li>
          <li><strong>They fall in "love" suspiciously quickly.</strong> Scammers use over-the-top, emotional language and declare their love within days or weeks. This tactic, known as "love bombing," is designed to make you feel special and lower your defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>They claim to be overseas.</strong> A common story involves being a contractor, business owner, or military member working abroad. This creates a plausible reason why they cannot meet in person and sets the stage for future requests for money related to travel or business problems.</li>
          <li><strong>They ask for money or financial help.</strong> This is the ultimate goal. The request may start small and will always come with a sob story and a promise to pay you back. They often ask for gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency because they are difficult to trace.</li>
          <li><strong>They pressure you to leave the dating app.</strong> They will insist on moving the conversation to a private platform like WhatsApp, Google Chat, or email. This removes them from the dating site's monitoring and makes it harder for you to report their profile.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you notice any of these signs, it's crucial to take a step back and confide in someone you trust. Scammers prey on secrecy and isolation. Remember, you're not alone, and seeking a second opinion is a sign of strength.</p>
