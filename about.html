    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> <strong>I’m Bil Miracle, and I help people protect their hearts, and their finances from online dating scams. 
        I haven’t always walked the path I’m on today. For a long time, my relationship with money was filled with confusion, survival, and secrecy. 
        I learned how to navigate the online world in ways that I’m not proud of, ways that hurt others and slowly began to damage me, too. I’ve seen firsthand how easily trust can be manipulated in today’s digital world.
         I know how professional and convincing scammers can be, because I’ve been on the inside. That experience gave me deep insight into the real methods, red flags, and psychological tactics these scammers use and now I use that knowledge to help others stay safe. 
         Today, I use the very knowledge I once misused to help others. I guide people who are looking for real connection online, and I teach them how to protect their hearts, their minds, and their money from scammers. 
         I’m not here to judge. I’m here to educate, support, and empower people like you who are looking for real connection and want to protect themselves online. I know how online romance scams work from the inside. 
         I know the psychology, the manipulation, and the red flags most people miss. I also know how painful it is to be deceived and how shame keeps people silent. 
         My mission now is to educate, protect and empower people like you who are looking for real connection and want to protect themselves online. No judgment. 
         Just support, truth, and tools that actually work. If you’re not sure whether to trust someone you’ve met online or if you’ve already been hurt, I’m here. 
         I’ve been on both sides. And I’ll help you stay safe while keeping your heart open to real connection. You deserve love that’s true. And you deserve to never feel foolish for trusting someone again.</strong></p>
