      <p>Hello, I'm someone who’s been behind the curtain—and now I’ve stepped into the light to help others avoid being hurt online.</p>

      <p>My journey started in a place I’m not proud of: I once scammed people online. But through deep reflection, self-education, and the decision to change, I’ve turned that experience into a mission to protect others.</p>

      <p>I now teach people how to spot the tactics scammers use, how to protect themselves emotionally and financially, and how to support loved ones who may be at risk. My story is real—and so is my commitment to change.</p>

      <p>I believe transformation is possible, and every one of us can rewrite our path. This site is a place of awareness, truth, and healing. Thank you for being here.</p>
