  <p class="mb-4">Online scammers often use emotional manipulation and urgency. Here are 5 red flags to look out for:</p>

  <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>They avoid video calls and always have an excuse.</li>
    <li>They fall in love very quickly and use emotional language.</li>
    <li>They claim to be overseas or in the military to avoid meeting.</li>
    <li>They ask for money, gift cards, or crypto “just this once.”</li>
    <li>They pressure you to move the conversation off the dating platform quickly.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mb-6">If you notice any of these signs, take a step back and talk to someone you trust. Scammers prey on silence and hope. You're not alone.</p>
